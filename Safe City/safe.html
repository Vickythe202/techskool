                <h2>Maintaining Safety</h2>
                <p>Maintaining safety should be the top priority for all drivers on the road. Adhering to traffic laws and regulations, staying focused and alert, and adapting to changing conditions are essential for safe driving.</p>

                <h2>Responsible Driving</h2>
                <p>Responsible driving involves being aware of your surroundings, obeying traffic signals and signs, and avoiding distractions. It's important to stay vigilant and make decisions that prioritize the safety of yourself and others on the road.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Obey Traffic Laws</h2>
            <p class="section-content">Follow posted speed limits, which are designed to keep traffic flowing safely. Come to a complete stop at all stop signs and red traffic lights. Use turn signals when changing lanes or turning to communicate your intentions to other drivers. Respect traffic signs, signals, and road markings, which are in place to guide the flow of traffic.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Focus on Driving</h2>
            <p class="section-content">Keep your eyes on the road and your hands firmly on the steering wheel at all times. Avoid distractions such as using your phone, eating, drinking, or adjusting the radio or music. Stay alert and be prepared to react quickly to unexpected situations, such as sudden braking by the vehicle in front of you or pedestrians crossing the street.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Maintain a Safe Following Distance</h2>
            <p class="section-content">Leave at least 3 seconds of following distance between your vehicle and the one in front of you. Increase the following distance in inclement weather, heavy traffic, or when driving at higher speeds. Adjust your following distance to account for the size and weight of your vehicle, as larger vehicles require more stopping distance.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Adjust to Conditions</h2>
            <p class="section-content">Slow down in poor weather conditions, such as rain, snow, or ice, which can affect traction and visibility. Turn on your headlights when visibility is reduced, such as in fog, heavy rain, or at dusk/dawn. Be extra cautious when driving in construction zones, where road conditions and traffic patterns may be unpredictable.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Wear Your Seatbelt</h2>
            <p class="section-content">Always wear your seatbelt and ensure that all passengers, including children, are properly restrained. Seatbelts are one of the most effective safety features in a vehicle, significantly reducing the risk of injury or death in the event of a crash.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Avoid Impaired Driving</h2>
            <p class="section-content">Never operate a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or medications that can impair your judgment or reaction time. Plan alternative transportation, such as a designated driver, taxi, or rideshare, if you know you will be consuming alcohol.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Be Courteous and Defensive</h2>
            <p class="section-content">Respect other drivers on the road and share the space safely. Anticipate the actions of other drivers and be prepared to react accordingly. Maintain a calm and patient demeanor, even when faced with aggressive or reckless behavior from other drivers.</p>
        </div>
        <p>By consistently practicing these safe driving habits, you can help create a safer environment for yourself and all other road users. Remember, safe driving is a shared responsibility that requires the collective effort of every driver.</p>
